Web app to check domain security info

done with backend in Nodejs, express router, frontend in ejs, and Mongodb database

Backend app contains router that uses mongoose to save or find domains according to user's requests

Backend also contains function that runs every month and goes over all domains in db and cheks 
their security data using two external apis (whois and nvt)
when finds security data for every domain, updates it to include that data in db
then next time user checks for the domain, they will see the data

backend also logs every request

all backend and frontend files contained within nodedocker_app folder, with dockerfile to set it up for deployment
project also contains nginx folder to set up nginx for deployment,
and docker-compose file to deploy nodejs, nginx and mongodb

db collections folder contains collections used in mongodb while testing app

to make the app more scalable, app could be split to two services, one containing the router and one containing the scheduled domain checks
they can communicate through docker-compose settings
